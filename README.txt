Create a basic HTML page
Ensure you make your page public so they are viewable
The index.html page will contain
  the !DOCTYPE declaration
  the <html> tag
  the <body> tag
  two different headings
  One paragraph - The paragraph will be about something you are interested in.  This will define what your individual project will be about (this can be changed, but it's a starting idea) 
  the proper closing tags.
